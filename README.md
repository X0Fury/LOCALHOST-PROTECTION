# LOCALHOST-PROTECTION
A VERY SIMPLE LOCALHOST PROTECTION
So I decided to make a precaution for your localhost because when you turn it on it is obviously accessible and in case you don't want it just use these files that I made :)
How to use:
Open The File index.php 
and everything will be commented on how to proceed :)
